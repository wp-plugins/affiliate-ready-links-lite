== Description ==

Itâ€™s great being an Amazon affiliate!  In fact, I earn a lot of income each and every month from their lucrative program.  However, creating affiliate links manually can be a bit tedious and time-consuming.  If you are building an Amazon review site or simply want to include text or image links throughout your blog posts, be prepared to spend quite a while building these links.

Ready Links has been developed to make it easier to add affiliate links to your posts and allows you to get on with the more important aspects of your web business.   This plugin will allow you to search the Amazon Marketplace and add text links or image links to your post without ever leaving your WordPress dashboard.
